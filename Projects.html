<p>
I've worked on various projects throughout my first year at university throughout all of my courses.
I've only coded assignments in the Python langugage during Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented
Programming. I created as shown below a Hangman Game for Introduction to Programming and an account set up
for a resturant in Object Oriented Programming. I look forward to creating more projects as the semester develops for Web and Script Programming 
to better enhance my skills and take an interest towards web development.
